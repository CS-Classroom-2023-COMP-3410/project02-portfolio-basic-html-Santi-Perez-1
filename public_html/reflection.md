# Reflection

Somthing I learned during the creation of this website is how to organize a multi-page site using only HTML. The main challenge was working without CSS since videos for this are everywhere. I solved this by using tables, fonts, and deprecated attributes. I also learned how to upload files to a Unix server and host a website publicly.
